The structure of the dashboard is as follows:
In data.py all plots, dataframes and other variables are beeing handled to feed into the front-end. 
app.py is used to structure the frontend with Shiny for Python.

We've done this to clean the codebase as rendering plots from the frontend itself can lead to confusion.
